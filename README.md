## What did I do ðŸ‘‡
+ Just did one task (Task 1) of a backend challenge for fun.
Link: https://github.com/b2w-marketplace/challenge-backend

#### How to run
+ This project runs on MySQL although it's not needed since I only did task one for now.
So just remember to check your user, password and port in application.properties.
+ Run ./mvnw spring-boot:run
## Backend Challenge BIT - SP

   The service must follow this definition:
